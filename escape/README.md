# ESCAPE datasets
The gold standards for the mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation datasets analyzed in our manuscript are obtained from the `chip_x.txt.zip` and `logof.txt.zip` files downloaded from the [ESCAPE database](http://www.maayanlab.net/ESCAPE/index.php) and are shared here to facilitate reproducibility.
[`data1`](https://github.com/gitter-lab/SINGE/tree/master/data1) and [`data2`](https://github.com/gitter-lab/SINGE/tree/master/data2) refer to the single-cell gene expression datasets in the SINGE repository.
Each expression dataset uses a different version of the ESCAPE gold standard.
